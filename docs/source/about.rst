About
=====

The MS/XPD beamline is used for X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) applications. Its flexible optical design spans a wide energy range of the order of 5 to 25 keV. A two-circle goniometer installed in the experimental hutch accommodates standard XRPD experiments.

At the MS/XPD beamline, the XRPD technique may be applied to material phase identification, quantitative analysis, atomic structural determinations, the characterization of a material’s microstructural properties such as structure imperfections or, domain size, and kinetic studies.

DAQ System & Features
----------------------

This software is developed to simplify the process of collecting data, ensuring accuracy and consistency in experiments. It allows users to set up their processes in efficient way. Additionally, it comes with this features:

    - GUI-Based Interface: The system boasts a user-friendly graphical interface, simplifying user interactions and limiting the incorrect user inputs.
    - Email Notification Service: The system provides email notifications (real-time) updates on scan status.
    - User/Software Actions: The tool is smart enough to pause in case of problems (e.g. current goes below certain limits, shutter is closed, problem in the vacuum, …etc ). As well, the user can (pause, resume, stop) the scan immediately.
    - UI Visualization Tool: A pop-up UI appears when a scan is started, offering a visual representation of the scan status and allowing easy review of experimental data.
    - Public Documentation targeting end-users (how-to).
