Experimental Data File Layout and Format
========================================

The scanning tool of MS-XPD beamline generates experimental data in compliance with “SESAME Experimental Data Management Policy (SEDMP)” from the data acquisition point of view. The policy can be found here: https://www.sesame.org.jo/for-users/user-guide/sesame-experimental-data-management-policy.

One of the pillars of the SEDMP is to generate experimental data in stander and well defined data formats, thus at SESAME, we are working on universal file format (HDF) as a stander experimental data files for all beamlines. For now the experimental data formats for MS-XPD are TIFF & DAT.
